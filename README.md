# R. Tesmond's Table of Addresses


#### Change log
6/19 - refactored App.js for more modularized code (added new components). Old code can be found here: https://github.com/tesmonrd/ReactAddressBook/tree/original_code

### New Features
* Dynamically search all records on current page (zip code searching is soon to come).
* Custom items per page selection. Type in your desired amount and press 'enter'.
* Mobile-friendly.

### Notes
* loaded JSON file of 260 randomly generated objects containing required properties
* some personalized styling choices were made -- namely maintaining the square style of the table, slight color variations, and placement.
* utilized bootstrap for the main nav bar, since the React component was the main focus and I wanted to maximize the time spent on the table and functionality
* given the one-day time limit, the code is not 100% optimized or ideal but I'm happy with the finished product!
